# Modules and Packages

# This lesson teaches you how to organize your code into separate files (modules) and 
# reuse it — just like Python’s built-in modules (math, random, etc.).



# Example 1: Creating and Importing a Module
# Let’s say you have two files in the same folder:

def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}, welcome to python world!")
def say_goodbye(name):
    print(f"Goodbye, {name}, see you soon!")


# Example 3: Using Built-in Modules

# Python has many built-in modules. For example:
import math

print(math.sqrt(9))
print(math.pi)
print(math.pow(3, 2))
