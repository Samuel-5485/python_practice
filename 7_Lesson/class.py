# Exercise: Create a Book Class

# Create a class called Book.

# The class should have these attributes:

# title

# author

# year

# The class should have a method called display_info() that prints:
# "Title: {title}, Author: {author}, Year: {year}"

# Create 2 objects of the Book class with different values.

# Call the display_info() method for both objects.

class Book:
    # constructor

        self.title = title

# Instance Variables vs Class Variables
    # Instance Variables ‚Üí unique to each object (we‚Äôve been using these: self.title, self.author)
    # Class Variables ‚Üí shared by all objects of the class

print(Book1.library_name)
print(Book2.library_name)
    # Key: All objects share the class variable, but instance variables are unique to each object.

# 2.Methods with Parameters
# You can also make methods that take extra arguments:
class Books:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
    
    def update_title(self, new_title):
        self.title = new_title
book1 = Books("Old Life", "Anan")
print(book1.title)

book1.update_title("The new Life")
print(book1.title)
    # update_title changes the instance variable after object creation.

# Exercise: Animal ‚Üí Dog

# You‚Äôre going to create two classes:

# Animal ‚Üí the parent class

# Dog ‚Üí the child class that inherits from Animal

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

        # method
    def make_sound(self):
        print(f"{self.name} {self.species}")
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, species, breed):
        super().__init__(name, species)
        self.breed = breed
    
    #method2

#create an object
Animal_1 = Animal("Lion", "Wild animal")
Dog_1 = Dog("Jos", "dog", "from two mate")

# call
Animal_1.make_sound()
Dog_1.make_sound()

# üêæ Instructions:

# Create a parent class Animal with:

# A constructor (__init__) that takes name and species

# A method make_sound() that prints:
# "Some generic animal sound"

# Create a child class Dog that:

# Inherits from Animal

# Has an extra attribute breed

# Overrides the make_sound() method to print:
# "Woof! Woof!"

# Finally, create an object from Dog and display:

# Its name, species, and breed
# Then call make_sound()


class Animals:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Method_1
    def makes_sound(self):

# create an object

# Cat_1.makes_sound()
# Bird_1.makes_sound()

# you can also even loop through them!
for animals in [Dog_1, Cat_1, Bird_1]:
    animals.makes_sound()
    # That‚Äôs called polymorphism ‚Äî the same method (makes_sound) behaves differently for each subclass.
    

# What Is Polymorphism?

# Polymorphism means "many forms".
# It allows you to use one method name that behaves differently depending on the object that calls it.

# In Python, polymorphism works naturally with inheritance ‚Äî just like your last example with Dog, Cat, and Bird.

class Animals:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

        return "meo!"
class Birds(Animals):

        return "shrip!"

# create an object
animals = [Dogs(), Cats(), Birds()]

# call

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.make_sound())

# ‚ö° Bonus: Polymorphism with Functions
